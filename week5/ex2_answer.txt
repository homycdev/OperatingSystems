When more than two threads access the data and try to change it at the same time a race condition occurs.
We do not know the order in which threads will try to access the data, because the thread scheduling algo can swap between them at any time.
herefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are "racing" to access/change the data.
